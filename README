NAME

  JdCrypt::CBC

DESCRIPTION

This provides CBC block-cipher-to-stream-cipher capability. If
you're using a block cipher like AES or Blowfish, you'll want
something like this to handle variable-length input.

FILES

bin2hex.rb
hex2bin.rb
  - Helpers for the test scripts so that you don't have to deal
    with binary data
crypt_dummy.rb
  - Helper class for testing. This does the simplest (and probably
    the worst for this purpose) encryption cipher: XOR.
test.rb
  - Test script. Usage: ruby test.rb
openssl_like.rb
  - Helper for testing. This behaves like command-line openssl,
    which makes it easy to see if JdCrypt::CBC is doing the wrong
    thing.
install.rb
  - Installs the module. Usage: ruby install.rb
mkrelease.sh
mktar.sh
  - Helpers to make releases. You don't need to touch these.
cbc.rb
  - The JdCrypt::CBC module which will be installed.

NOTES

COMPATIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE

Ruby 1.9: Ruby core works, test.rb with Crypt::Rijndael takes 0.15s
Rubinius 1.2.3: Ruby core works, test.rb with Crypt::Rijndael takes 0.13s (0.18s)
